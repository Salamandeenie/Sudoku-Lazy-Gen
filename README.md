# Sudoku Lazy Gen

**Sudoku Lazy Gen** is a Sudoku game finder that uses math to calculate valid Sudoku games. It reduces complexity by cheating, and only calculates the 4 corner blocks of a board. This means that some boards cannot be found by this tool.

However, this tool is merely a proof of concept. I got bored one day, and this is relatively simple (I thought it would have been harder, lol).

I may revisit this project, and rework how it builds boards (Perhaps calculating the outermost blocks), but as of now I don't see a point.


If you are using this tool, I HIGHLY suggest not generating more than like 2,500 boards on a computer, and no more than like 500 on a mobile device. But I won't stop you. It ain't my fault you want to live on the danger side.

As always, if you want to take my crap code, and work with it, good luck, and please give me credit somewhere.

Anyways,
